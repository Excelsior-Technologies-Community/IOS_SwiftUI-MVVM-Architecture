## Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to implement **MVVM (Model–View–ViewModel)** correctly in a SwiftUI application. It focuses on:

* How MVVM works in practice.
* Why MVVM is necessary for scalable apps.
* How proper folder structure improves maintainability.
* How to separate UI, business logic, and data layers.

---

## Introduction

Modern iOS applications grow very quickly. Without a strong architecture, projects become difficult to maintain, test, and scale. **MVVM (Model–View–ViewModel)** is one of the most effective architectures for SwiftUI applications.

This project uses:

* SwiftUI
* Combine
* async/await
* Clean folder structure
* Clear separation of responsibilities

> The most important part of this project is its **folder structure and responsibility separation**.

---

## What is MVVM?

MVVM consists of three layers:

| Layer | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Model** | Data and business entities |
| **View** | UI only |
| **ViewModel** | Presentation logic and UI state |

**MVVM ensures:**

* UI does not contain business logic.
* Business logic does not depend on UI.
* Code is easier to test and maintain.

---

## Why Do We Need MVVM?

### Problems Without MVVM

In many beginner projects:

* API calls are written inside Views.
* Validation logic is placed in Views.
* Navigation logic is mixed with UI.
* Multiple Boolean flags control UI state.

**This leads to:**

* **Massive Views** (500–1000 lines).
* Tight coupling between screens.
* Difficult debugging and no unit testing.
* Poor scalability (the "Massive View/ViewController problem").

---

## How MVVM Solves This

MVVM separates responsibilities clearly:

| Responsibility | Layer |
| --- | --- |
| UI rendering | View |
| UI state | ViewModel |
| Business rules | UseCase |
| API calls | Repository |
| Validation | Core utilities |
| Navigation | Router |

---

## MVVM Data Flow

1. **User Action** → View
2. **View** → ViewModel
3. **ViewModel** → UseCase
4. **UseCase** → Repository
5. **Repository** → API / Data Source
6. **Data flows back** → Repository → UseCase → ViewModel (`@Published` updates) → View (automatic UI refresh)

**Key rule:** Views never communicate directly with APIs or databases.

---

## MVVM Implementation

### View

* Display UI, observe ViewModel, and forward user actions.
* SwiftUI owns the ViewModel lifecycle using `@StateObject`.

```swift
@StateObject private var viewModel = UserListViewModel()

```

### ViewModel

* Hold UI state and execute UseCases.
* Expose state using `@Published`.

```swift
@Published var users: [User]
@Published var state: ViewState

```

### Model

* Represent data with no UI or framework dependency.

```swift
struct User {
    let id: Int
    let name: String
    let email: String
}

```

## Code Explanation (File-by-File)

### 1. App Layer – `MVVMTeachingApp.swift`

Defines the application entry point and root view.

```swift
@main
struct MVVMTeachingApp: App {
    var body: some Scene {
        WindowGroup {
            UserListView()
        }
    }
}

```

### 2. Core Layer – `ViewState.swift`

Represents UI state in a structured way to avoid multiple Boolean flags.

```swift
enum ViewState {
    case idle
    case loading
    case success
    case error(String)
}

```

### 3. Core Layer – `Validator.swift`

Centralizes validation logic.

```swift
enum Validator {
    static func isValidEmail(_ email: String) -> Bool {
        email.contains("@")
    }

    static func isValidPassword(_ password: String) -> Bool {
        password.count >= 6
    }
}

```

### 4. Domain Layer – `User.swift`

Business model independent of UI.

```swift
struct User: Identifiable, Decodable {
    let id: Int
    let name: String
    let email: String
}

```

### 5. Domain Layer – `FetchUsersUseCase.swift`

Encapsulates business logic for fetching users.

```swift
final class FetchUsersUseCase {
    private let repository = UserRepository()

    func execute(page: Int) async throws -> [User] {
        try await repository.fetchUsers(page: page)
    }
}

```

### 6. Data Layer – `APIService.swift`

Handles network requests.

```swift
final class APIService {
    func fetch<T: Decodable>(_ type: T.Type, from url: URL) async throws -> T {
        let (data, _) = try await URLSession.shared.data(from: url)
        return try JSONDecoder().decode(T.self, from: data)
    }
}

```

### 7. Presentation Layer – `UserListViewModel.swift`

Manages UI state and data loading.

```swift
@MainActor
final class UserListViewModel: ObservableObject {

    @Published var users: [User] = []
    @Published var state: ViewState = .idle

    private let fetchUsersUseCase = FetchUsersUseCase()

    func loadUsers() async {
        state = .loading
        do {
            users = try await fetchUsersUseCase.execute(page: 1)
            state = .success
        } catch {
            state = .error(error.localizedDescription)
        }
    }
}

```

## Important Developer Rules

### Do This

* **Follow folder structure:** Maintains clean architecture.
* **Keep Views simple:** Avoids massive Views.
* **Use ViewModels for logic:** Separation of concerns.
* **Use UseCases:** Single responsibility.
* **Use Repositories:** Decoupled data access.

### Avoid This

* **API calls inside Views:** Leads to tight coupling.
* **Validation inside Views:** Architecture violation.
* **Multiple @main files:** Causes build issues.
* **Random folder placement:** Hard to maintain.

## Final Note

This project is not just about MVVM. It is about **discipline, structure, and responsibility separation**.
